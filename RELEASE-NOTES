RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).

Release 52n-sensorweb-sos-4.0.0-Beta2
===================================

--- New features ---

    * Related Feature Support in InsertSensor, InsertObservation, GetObservation, GetFeatureOfInterest (see #922 or Documentation->Features->Related Features for more details) 
    * Dynamic WSDL generation, query via http://[HOST]:[PORT]/[WEBAPP_NAME]/wsdl, e.g. http://localhost:8080/52n-sos-webapp-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT/wsdl
    * InsertSensor: 
        * for more than one offering
        * again for another offering
        * again for the same offering if the procedure was deleted before, observations inserted before deletion are not provided
    * Serialization of cache: serialize cache to file after updates and during shutdown, load cache from file during startup if exist (fast startup)
    * Administrator: 
        * GUI to en-/disable single operations
        * GUI to en-/disable single encodings
        * GUI to en-/disable single bindings
        * Clear database, insert test data, remove test data, reload cache
    * Sort elements in GetCapabilities response by A-Z, 0-9,...
    * Storing codespace of gml:identifier for featureOfInterest and observation in DB
    * RESTful Binding
    * POX Binding
    * DeleteObservation operation
    * SOS 1.0.0 support:
        * GetCapabilities (KVP,POX,SOAP)
        * DescribeSensor (KVP,POX,SOAP)
        * GetObservation (KVP,POX,SOAP)
        * GetFeatureOfInterest (POX,SOAP)
    * WaterML 2.0 Encoding
    * GetDataAvailability operation, de-/encoding
    * Additional Supported filter (need more tests regarding correct behavior):
        * temporal:	After, Before, Begins, Ends, EndedBy, BegunBy, TContains, Overlaps, Meets, MetBy, OverlappedBy

--- Changes ---

    * Database model has changed:
        * observation are not inserted twice if they relate to a different offering but same procedure, observedProperty and featureOfInterest
        * store procedure- and observableProperty-id in observation table
    * Change coordinate order handling from de-/encoder to DAOs
    * Exception and Response Code handling
    * SosEventBus: fire and listen for events, currently used by cache updates after transactions
    * Cache:
        * switch from database updates to in memory updates
        * update cache after transactional operation directly
    * The settings are saved in a separate, independent database
    * Database queries for Observation returning specialized types depending on stored value

--- Fixed bugs ---

    * Insert an observation again without an error.
    * [Bug 800] Missing operation metadata parameter for operation InsertResultTemplate and InsertResult
    * [Bug 805] InsertSensor request is not parsed correct: InsertSensorRequest.getProcedureDescription().getOfferingIdentifiers() returns empty list
    * [Bug 811] ClassCastException when inserting observation with TimePeriod phenomenonTime and referenced resultTime
    * [Bug 834] Administrator: Reset using reset_admin.sql does not work
    * [Bug 843] Check hasCode() implementations for resetting hash
    * [Bug 847] Useless error message when sending POX to SOAP endpoint
    * [Bug 883] When single observation with resultTime are merged, the returned resultTime is not the latest
