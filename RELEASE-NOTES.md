# 52Â°North SOS RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).

## Release 52n-sensorweb-sos-5.0.2
 
### Change Log

  - add more configuration options for docker
  - add default env variables
  - Fix issue with duplicated and not initialized datasets in the database when inserting complex observations.
  - Set observation identifier = pkid if not defined in request (configurable via setting)
  - Fix issue with duplicate created datasets (only without platform entity) when inserting ComplexObservations.
