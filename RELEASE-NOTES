RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).
