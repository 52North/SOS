<h4>Tell the world!</h4>
<p>If your SOS instance is publicly available please consider informing <a class="telltheworld" href="mailto:sos-installation@52north.org">us</a> or the community on <a class="telltheworld" href="mailto:swe@52north.org" target="_blank">swe@52north.org</a> or use our <a href="http://sensorweb.forum.52north.org/">forums</a> so that many people can profit from your hard work. If you like, your SOS can also be listed in our <a href="https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/SosExampleServices">Wiki</a> as an example.</p>

<h4>Code development/ bug fixing</h4>
<p>The best way to get to know a software is to use it! Implement features that you yourself need - new software, code snippets, adaptations, extensions, etc.  Help others solve their problems. Fix bugs and enhance the existing software. There are many ways to get started!</p>
<p>Contact the <a href="http://52north.org/communities/community-leaders/">community leader</a> who is responsible for the software to which you would like to contribute. If you are interested in providing code, please read our <a href="http://52north.org/about/licensing/cla-guidelines">contributors license agreement (CLA) guidelines </a>. If you have questions about this or our software licensing, please check our <a href="http://52north.org/about/licensing/">licensing pages</a>.</p>

<h4>Testing / bug reporting</h4>
<p>The development of high quality software demands a lot of testing. Run the latest development code and provide feedback on changes as they occur. Report errors or possible improvements. The best way to test 52&deg;North's development code is to use the <a href="https://github.com/52North/SOS/issues/">52&deg;North SOS GitHub issue tracker</a>. This requires an account. Simply sign up with a legitimate email address. We also have various <a href="http://52north.org/resources/mailing-list-and-forums/">mailing lists/forums</a> in which you can also report bugs.</p>

<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>Help produce official software documentation, i.e. user guides, tutorials, how tos, FAQs, etc. Document a solution to a problem. Check, proof and test documents for accuracy. Contact the <a href="http://52north.org/communities/community-leaders/">community leader</a> who is responsible for the software documentation in question.</p>

<h4>Discuss and Support</h4>
<p>Join or start discussions about new feature ideas, help answer questions in our <a href="http://52north.org/resources/mailing-list-and-forums/">mailings lists and forums</a>.</p>

<h4>Partnership</h4>
<p>Make your commitment official and become a <a href="http://52north.org/about/get-involved/partnership-levels">52&deg;North cooperation partner!</a></p>

<h4>Thanks for using the 52&deg;North SOS and thank you for your support of the Sensor Web community!</h4>
