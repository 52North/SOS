# 52Â°North SOS RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).
