RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).

Changes since last release
==================================

 --- New features ---
 
    * Binding selection by ContentType at /sos and /service
    * Add columns to mapping files for an easier integration of the Timeseries API (only for Series concept)
      * Added first/latest time (all) and value (only OM_Measurement) columns to series table and update 
        these columns during insertion process
    * Add Microsoft SQL Server support
      * https://github.com/52North/SOS/commit/e288e502fbc1f0b833bad1e90d60b36c491d0792
    * Create JSON cache dump in admin interface
      * https://github.com/52North/SOS/commit/9cef2ba00c862058e7ada1f7a2862ef98a3e3096
    * GetObservation with multiple temporal filter and different valueReferences
      * same valueReference:       filter OR filter
      * different valueReferences: (filterA1 OR filterA2) AND filterB
    * Streaming response:
      * can be activated via settings
      * StreamWriter for SOAP envelope, O&M 2.0, and WaterML 2.0
      * Allows bigger responses because the no XML DOM-Tree is created
    * Streaming datasource (Hibernate) for GetObservation:
      * can be activate via settings
      * Query observation metadata and create template observations
      * In the encoder the observation values are queried
      * Two possibilities, configurable via settings:
      	* scroll: send query and get scrollable values
      	* chunk: 
      	  * send paging requests and process each chunk
      	  * chunk size is configurable via settings
      * reduced latency for GetObservation response
    * Add datasource dependent DAO and ConnectionProvider loading
      * This allows to include DAOs and ConnectionProvider for different datasources in the same SOS which 
         can be selected during the installation.
      * Corresponding to the selected datasource, the required DAOs and ConnectionProvider are loaded during 
        the initialization.
